### My first web game - HTML and jQuery
---

To use it, simply:

* Click on the blue bubbles for win 12 points (for win -> 2016 total points in 90sec)
* Click on the orange bubbles -> -12 points
* Click on the green bubbles -> -5sec

TRICK: the game is more funny with smartphone than a destock 
```html
<h1>Enjoy and good luck !</h1>
```

WARNING: I make this game for fun with HTML and jQuery, it's the first time.

Good game !
